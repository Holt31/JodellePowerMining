# Jodelle Power Mining
---
## Overview
Attention! I did not create this plugin! I am just updating it because the creator droped it in 2013 and I like this plugin very much. All the credits go to bloodyshade.

JodellePowerMining is a plugin for spigot that adds a new set of tools to the game. These tools have a different behavior from the original version. An example is instead of a pickaxe mining just one block, it can mine 3x3.

## Features
- Adds 2 different tools to the game, Hammer and Shovel.
- Mining one block makes the other blocks around to be broken, a 3x3 hole.
- All mineble/diggable blocks can be configured in the confile file.
- Configurable recipes for the powertools (halfway done)

## Todo List
- Implement a way to check the quantity of the items, probably the best way is to use a PrepareCraftEvent to check what the player is crafting and make sure the items are in the correct amount.
